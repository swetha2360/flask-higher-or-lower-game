# Flask Higher or Lower Game 🎯

A fun and simple number guessing game built with **Python** and **Flask**! The app picks a random number between 0 and 9, and users guess the number by visiting different URL paths. The server responds with messages and GIFs based on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## 🚀 What I Learned

- Flask routing and dynamic URLs (`/<int:guess>`)
- Using advanced decorators with Flask
- Rendering styled HTML with Flask responses
- Flask debugging tools
- How to build interactive web apps with just Python
